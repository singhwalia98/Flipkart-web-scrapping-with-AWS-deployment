# WebScrapper

In this repository, I have completed a web scrapping project for Flipkart website with AWS deployment. The application can take any "Product name" as an input which is listed on the Flipkart website and return us the outputs which are:

1. Product Name.
2. Customer Name (As given by them on the review).
3. Rating given by the customer.
4. Review title given by the customer.
5. Full review about the Product.
